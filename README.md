- 🔭 Currently a native Android developer but in love with everything TypeScript (especially React Native) 🤓🥸🥳.
- 👯 I’m looking forward to collaborate on JS/TS libraries/frameworks that focus on pleasant UX and smooth developer experience.
- 🤔 I’m looking for a pal who's interested in pair programming in React Native, Ionic, Android or any of the frameworks that I am interested in.
- 💬 Ask me about React and React Native documents; I can weep all day long about Android fragmentation/lifecycle 😭😁.
- 📫 Reach me via my <a href="https://hojat72elect.github.io/">website</a>.
- 😄 Pronouns: he/him
- ⚡ Fun fact: I twice came across black bears in nature 😁🐻
- ☕ If you have enjoyed using the software tools I'm creating, I'd be thankful if you <a href="https://www.buymeacoffee.com/hojat">buy me a coffee</a> 😉.
