- 🔭 A software engineer with a wide variety of interests in computer science. 🤓🥸🥳.

- 😄 Pronouns: he/him
- ⚡ Fun fact: I twice came across black bears in nature 🐻, have lived in 2 different countries and speak both Persian and English.
- ☕ If you have enjoyed using the software tools I'm creating, I'd be thankful if you <a href="https://www.buymeacoffee.com/hojat">buy me a coffee</a> 😉.
